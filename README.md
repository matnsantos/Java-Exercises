## Java Basics
- Concepts used: Variables, data types, operators, methods, etc.

## Data Types
- Examples and use cases of primitive and reference types.
- Enum Types

## Control Flow
- Examples demonstrating conditional logic and loops through Conditional Statements and Recursive Methods.

## Math and Numbers
- Examples of using the Math class for calculations.

## Object-Oriented Programming
- Explanation of OOP concepts (classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism).
- Sample codes showcasing OOP principles such as:
- Constructors, Static Members, Nested Classes, Inheritanmce, Abstract Classes, Interfaces, Encapsulation and Polymorphism

## Exception Handling
- Description of exception handling in Java.
- Examples of try-catch blocks and custom exceptions.

- Examples of using functional programming concepts.

## Multithreading
- Brief explanation of multithreading in Java.
- Examples of creating and managing threads.

## Data Structures
- Overview of commonly used data structures (arrays, lists, maps).
- Examples of implementing and using these structures.

## Strings and I/O
- Description of string manipulation and input/output operations.
- Examples of reading from and writing to files.

## Algorithms
- Overview of algorithms learned (sorting, searching).
- Examples and explanations of algorithm implementations.

## Unit Testing
- Introduction to unit testing in Java (JUnit).
- Examples of writing test cases for Java programs.

## Regular Expressions
- Explanation of regular expressions and their use cases in Java.
